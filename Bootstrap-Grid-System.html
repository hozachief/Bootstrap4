Bootstrap Grid System
Bootstrap grid system provides a quick and convenient way to create
responsive website layouts. Bootstrap 4 introduces the new
mobile-first flexbox grid system that appropriately scales up to 12
columns as the device or viewport size increases.
Bootstrap 4 includes predefined grid classes for quickly making grid
layouts for different types of devices. For example, .col-* classes
to create grid columns for extra small devices like mobile phones in 
portrait mode. The .col-sm-* classes to create grid columns for small 
screen devices like mobile phones in landscape mode. The .col-md-* classes
for medium screen devices like tablets.

Applying any .col-sm-* class to an element will not only affect its
styling on small devices, but also on medium, large and extra large
devices having screen width greater than or equal to 540px, if a
.col-md-*, .col-lg-* or .col-xl-* class is not present...

To use this 12 column responsive grid system to create rows and columns first
create a container that acts as a wrapper for your rows and columns using
the .container class. Create rows inside the container using the .row class,
and to create columns inside any row you can use the .col-*, .col-sm-*,
.col-md-*, .col-lg-* and .col-xl-* classes. The columns are actual content
areas where we will place our content.
